# What's in here?
Folder of MD and HTML files created in support of an application to role of research associate with the Aerosol-MFR project.

HTML files are cleaner because the code cells are collapsed by default, but can be opened for review. But the HTML files won't render within the GitHub, so you will have to download it before viewing.

MD files are do render well in GitHub but some formatting is lost, and all code cells are non-collapsible.
